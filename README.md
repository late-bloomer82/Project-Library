# Project-Library
JavaScript Project


Takeaway

Learned a lot from this. Note to self: I could of styled this a little better if I took the time, but I decided I'll save that for later bigger projects. Probably when I'll start using high scale frameworks. For now, getting the logic and the javascript right is most important.
